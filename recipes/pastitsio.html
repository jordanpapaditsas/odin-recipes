      <li>750gr ground beef</li>
      <li>2 onions</li>
      <li>1 clove(s) of garlic</li>
      <li>1 tbsp thyme</li>
      <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tbps tomatoe paste</li>
      <li>100ml red wine</li>
      <li>400g canned tomatoes</li>
      <li>100g butter</li>
      <li>1 liter whole milk</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
      <li>3 egg yolks</li>
      <li>100g all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>300g bucatini pasta</li>
      <li>200g feta cheese</li>
      <li>50g gruyere cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 bunch parsley</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the finely chopped onions, Sauté for 3-4 minutes, until the onions caramelize nicely.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and continue to sauté.</li>
      <li>Add the tomato paste and sauté for at least 2 minutes. It is important to sauté the tomato paste to give it a more intense flavor.</li>
      <li>Add the ground meat. Break it up with a wooden spoon and brown for 4-5 minutes. At this point you may need to add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
      <li>Add the wine and let the alcohol evaporate. Add the canned tomatoes.</li>
      <li>When ready, remove from heat.</li>
      <li> Heat the butter in a pot over medium heat. As soon as it melts (do not let it burn), add the flour. 
        Beat with a hand whisk and sauté the flour for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the milk, in small batches, whisking continuously so that no lumps form in the mixture.</li>
      <li>When the béchamel sauce starts to thicken, you have to be very careful not to let it burn on the bottom. Whisk continuously to avoid this.</li>
      <li>When ready, remove from heat and add salt, pepper, and the grated gruyere.</li>
      <li>To complete, add the 3 egg yolks and whisk to incorporate.</li>
      <li>Add the pasta to a pot full of salted water. Boil 1-2 minutes less than the instructions on the box. 
        They need to be al dente because they will cook further in the oven, so do not overcook.</li>
      <li>When the pasta is ready, drain and spread in the baking pan.</li>
      <li>Add feta cheese, season to taste and set aside until needed.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 180* C (350* F) Fan. Bring back the baking pan containing the pasta mixture.</li>
      <li>To the ground meat, add a ladleful of the béchamel sauce. Mix until completely incorporated.</li>
      <li>The béchamel sauce will make the ground meat mixture hold together better when serving.</li>
      <li>Spread the ground meat mixture over the pasta in the baking pan.</li>
      <li>Pour the remaining béchamel sauce over the ground meat.</li>
      <li>Bake for 40 minutes or until the béchamel turns golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
