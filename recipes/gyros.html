    </p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>300gr Pork (of your choice)</li>
      <li>3-4 potatoes</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes</li>
      <li>1-2 pita breads</li>
      <li>100gr Tzatziki (alternatively sour cream)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Pepper</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Salt</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Sweet Paprika</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Oregano</li>
      <li>50g olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the meat into thin slices. Tenderize the meat with a mallet to soften the slices, make them very thin, and set them aside.</li>
      <li>In a bowl add olive oil, salt, paprika, pepper, garlic, onion, oregano, and mix.</li>
      <li>Put the meat into the bowl with the marinade and mix well. Ideally, you should refrigerate it, covered with plastic wrap, for 12 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180° C (350° F) set to fan.</li>
      <li>Cut potatoes in pieces and fry them in a pan.</li>
      <li>Cut the tomato into slices, and the onion into four pieces. Let them in a plate</li>
      <li>Wrap with aluminum foil and bake for 3 hours. Uncover and bake for another 30-40 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li>Cut the gyros that is baked and golden all around, and set it aside. You can put the rest of the gyros back in the oven to turn golden where it is cut.</li>
      <li>Divide the tzatziki sauce among the pitas, the tomato into slices, the onion into slices, the French fries, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
